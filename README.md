# [neovim](https://neovim.io/) config

## Remember a few things:

Navigate to `~/.config/nvim` and run:

`git clone https://github.com/galacticalex/config.git .`

Opening first time will error out because the colour scheme is not installed. This is not a problem. Proceed, then run:

`:PlugInstall`

Exit and re-open neovim.
